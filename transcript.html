    <h1>DESCRIPTION OF VIDEO</h1>
    <p>
        The video starts off with My Melody hiding her stuffed animal in a pink bag. Her, Kuromi and Hello Kitty are holding a 
        sleepover. She pats her plushie on the head, before closing the bag. She slips her sleeping mask on her forehead while  
        Kuromi says: "Whatever! Night!" and fluffs her pillow. My Melody walks over to her mattress, jumps over Hello Kitty's and says:
        "Oh, pardon me, Hello Kitty!. She looks at her flat mattress, not in the mood to go to sleep. She asks: 
        Are you sure you, um, don't want to play charades?" nervously. Hello Kitty answers: "Oh, we'll have all day tomorrow to hang out.", Kuromi also 
        chimes in: "And, we haven't even figured out, what we're gonna do.". My Melody is clearly disappointed, but says:  "Oh, sure...Good night..."
        She pulls the sleeping mask on her eyes, and Kuromi shuts the light off. Clock ticking and shadows from the window indicate the passage of time, Melody still being unable to sleep. 
        She misses her plushie, and after rolling around in bed for a while, gets up and sneaks over to where she hid her toy.
        She finds it and happily runs back to her bed. But Hello Kitty is startled by the noise, and she turns the light on, and asks:
        "Everything okay, My Melody?" with a worried voice. My Melody apologises: "Oh! Nothing! Sorry to wake you."
